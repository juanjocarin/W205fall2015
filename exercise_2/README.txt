====EXERCISE 2====

--Juanjo Carin--

The code for each step can be run with the corresponding .sh file (except when the step requires creating the Twitter API credentials in a website, or modifying a file; in the former case the access keys hhave already been introduced in the code, in the latter the modified files have already been pushed into this repository). This includes cloning the repository, installing Python libraries, running the Storm project and the final Python scripts, etc.

Only the last Step (4) has been divided in 3 .sh files (because the output of each one occupies a whole screen).

Do NOTE that the .sh files include absolute paths, so the file structure must be the same in order to run them (e.g., mkdir /data/w205/ex2, the folder where I cloned this exercise's files, assumes that route /data/w205 already exists).

All these .sh files are located in the rood directory of this repository, which also contains some Python files (mainly for Step 4; all of them are run by the .sh files so there's no need to run them calling Python), a folder with screenshots, a plot of the histogram, the document "Architecture.pdf" which contains much more detailed information, and of course the folder that contains the Storm project.
