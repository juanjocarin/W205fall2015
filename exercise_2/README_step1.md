TOPOLOGY OF THE PROJECT:

There is no need to change EX2tweetwordcount.clj (previously named tweetwordcount.clj) because the (Python) file names and class names (inside those Python files) are correct: they are the ones that appear in the bolts and spouts inside the /src folder that we have copied from the /tweetwordcount directory.
