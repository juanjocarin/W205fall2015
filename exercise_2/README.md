# EXERCISE 2

The code for each step can be run with the corresponding .sh file (except when the step requires creating the Twitter API credentials in a website, or modifying a file; in the latter case the modified file has already been pushed into this repository).

Please **READ** the supplementary README files for comments about each step of the Exercise.

Do **NOTE** that the .sh files include absolute paths, so the file structure must be the same in order to run them (e.g., `mkdir /data/w205/ex2`, the folder where I cloned this exercise's files, assumes that route `/data/w205` already exists).
